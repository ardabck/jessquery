  "description": "Modern JavaScript is pretty good, but typing document.querySelector() is a pain. This is a tiny library that makes DOM manipulation easy. jQuery is around 30kb, while this is only around 2kb (800 bytes when minified and gzipped). Lots of JSDoc comments so it's self-documenting and works great with TypeScript.",
